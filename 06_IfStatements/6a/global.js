No if-statements yet. 
Instead, well do some exploration of the relational 
and equality operators so you can see them at work. 
Use the console (and console.log()) to work your way
 through these statements by typing them exactly as 
 you see them into your Javascript file. 
 Before you run the code, 
 predict the output of each statement 
 (like Ive done the first one for you).

(Note that some of the below examples use a double-equals == and some use a triple-equals ===.)

console.log( "5 == '5' is " + (5 == '5') ); // true
console.log( "5 == 'five' is " + (5 == 'five') );
console.log( "5 == '6' is " + (5 == '6') );
console.log( "5 === '5' is " + (5 === '5') );
console.log( "5 == 2 + 3 is " + (5 == 2 + 3) );
console.log( "5 == 5 is " + (5 == 5) );
console.log( "5 === 5 is " + (5 === 5) );
console.log( "true == 'true' is " + (true == 'true') );
console.log( "true === 'true' is " + (true === 'true') );
console.log( "true == false is " + (true == false) );
console.log( "5 == 12 is " + (5 == 12) );
console.log( "5 != 12 is " + (5 != 12) );
console.log( "5 < 12 is " + (5 < 12) );
console.log( "5 <= 12 is " + (5 <= 12) );
console.log( "5 > 12 is " + (5 > 12));
console.log( "5 >= 12 is " + (5 >= 12));

In your HTML document, 
record your answers (organized by statements) 
and explain what the operator does. 
Youll want to record your guess, 
whether your guess was right or wrong, and, 
if it was wrong, why.
